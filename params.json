At that time, the application should be in the state exactly\r\nas the moment you frozen the time. By doing that, programmers can develop next behaviors of application easily. They\r\ndon't have to reproduce amount of behaviors to come to the state they need to develop next ones for the application.\r\nSave time and eliminate boring repeat jobs right?.\r\n\r\n\r\nLICENSE\r\n==================\r\nApache\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
