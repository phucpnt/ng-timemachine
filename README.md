What is the idea?
==================

The timeline machine is structure for easy build angular application.
It is heavily inspired by FLUX architecture.

With that structure you can easy manipulate the state/timeline of the application.

* You record the timeline.
* You can frozen the timeline and refresh the application. At that time, the application should be in the state exactly
as the moment you frozen the time. By doing that, programmers can develop next behaviors of application easily. They
don't have to reproduce amount of behaviors to come to the state they need to develop next ones for the application.
Save time and eliminate boring repeat jobs right?.
